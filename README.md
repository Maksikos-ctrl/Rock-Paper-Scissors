# Rock-Paper-Scissors
We will create a rock paper scissors game using python.  While playing with the computer, you will take turns making a move (choose a stone, scissors or paper) and the program will tell you which of you won.  Let's remember the rules:  1.stone blunts scissors   2.paper covers the stone   3. scissors cut the paper.
