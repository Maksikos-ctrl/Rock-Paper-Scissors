# Rock-Paper-Scissors
we will create a rock paper scissors game using python.  While playing with the computer, you will take turns making a move (choose a stone, scissors or paper) and the program will tell you which of you won.  Let's remember the rules:     1.stone blunts scissors    2.paper covers the stone    3. scissors cut the paper.
